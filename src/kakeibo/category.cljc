  "Deterministic, rule-driven categorization.

  **No model runs in this path, by design.** Categories feed a double-entry
  ledger and a spending report; a language model that guesses \"groceries\"
  for a rent payment produces a number that looks authoritative and is wrong,
  and nothing downstream can tell. Rules are ordered data (first match wins),
  so every category is traceable to the rule id that produced it and an
  unmatched transaction stays visibly `:uncategorized` instead of being
  assigned a plausible bucket.

  A rule:

      {:rule/id       :cat/utilities
       :rule/category :utilities
       :rule/match    {:description/contains [\"東京電力\" \"東京ガス\"]
                       :amount/sign          :negative}}

  All predicates present in `:rule/match` must hold (AND). Supported:

  | key                    | meaning                                     |
  |------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
  | `:description/contains`| any listed substring occurs (OR within)     |
  | `:description/regex`   | pattern matches                             |
  | `:amount/sign`         | `:negative` (outflow) or `:positive` (inflow)|
  | `:amount/min-magnitude`| magnitude in minor units is at least n      |
  | `:tx/account`          | account keyword, or a set of them           |

  `:description/regex` is compiled with the host's own regex engine, so keep
  patterns to the common subset — a pattern relying on Java-only or
  JavaScript-only syntax will behave differently across runtimes."
