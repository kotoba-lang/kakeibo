  "Exact money parsing for statement rows.

  Statement rows arrive as text (`\"1,234\"`, `\"¥1,234\"`, `\"１，２３４円\"`,
  `\"(1,234)\"`, `\"-1,234\"`). This namespace turns that text into a signed
  integer in the currency's *minor unit* — the same convention
  `kotoba-lang/banking` and `kotoba-lang/card` use, so no BigDecimal and no
  float ever touches a money value.

  Two properties are deliberate:

  - **No floating point, no host interop.** Digits are folded into an integer
    with `(+ (* 10 acc) d)`, so the same code is exact on the JVM, in
    ClojureScript, and under a Kotoba/Wasm host. There is no `parseInt`, no
    `Long/parseLong`, no reader conditional.
  - **Fail closed.** Anything not understood returns a problem map rather
    than `nil` or `0`. A statement line silently read as zero is worse than a
    rejected batch: it understates spending and nothing surfaces the loss."
