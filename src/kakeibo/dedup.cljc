  "Transaction identity and de-duplication across overlapping statement windows.

  This is the problem an aggregator actually has to solve. Statements are
  fetched by date window, windows overlap (you re-fetch the last 90 days every
  week), and the same purchase therefore arrives many times. Summing what you
  fetched overstates spending; keying on the payee understates it, because two
  identical coffees on the same day are two transactions.

  The rule here:

  - A transaction's **key** is its institution reference when the statement
    provides one (authoritative), else the tuple
    `account | date | amount | normalized description`.
  - Within one batch, transactions sharing a key are numbered by
    **occurrence** (0, 1, 2 …) in statement order.
  - Merging batches keeps, per key, the **highest occurrence count any single
    batch reported** — not the sum. Two overlapping windows that each saw two
    identical coffees yield two, and a window that genuinely saw three yields
    three.

  Identity is a readable tuple string, not a hash. A hash would need a hash
  function this library has no reason to own, and would make a mis-keyed
  transaction impossible to diagnose by reading it."
