;; No clock, no network, no model: the same inputs always produce the same
;; output file. That is what makes it honest to register under
;; `tamaki exec` — which records `submitted -> leased -> started ->
;; succeeded|failed` with the real argv and exit code — rather than under
;; `tamaki submit`, which would hand the goal to a model and claim an agent did
;; work it did not do.
;;
;; Exit codes: 0 when the ingest is clean; 1 when any row was rejected, any
;; transaction was unpostable, or the mapping did not validate; 2 on a usage or
;; file error. A tick that partially failed must not look like a success.
